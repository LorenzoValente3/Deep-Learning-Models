# Deep Learning Models

This repository aims to implement differents Deep Learning (DL) Models as suggested in research papers using [Keras](https://keras.io/).
The implemented models are then applied to two different datasets. 
Models listed here are some cases simplified versions of the ones ultimately described in papers, but I chose to focus on getting the core ideas rather than getting every layer configurations right.
