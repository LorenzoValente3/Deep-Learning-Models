# Deep Learning Models
> Keras implementation of Deep Learning models to the two different datasets

This repository aims to implement using [Keras](https://keras.io/) differents Deep Learning (DL) Models as suggested in research papers.
The implemented models are then applied to two different datasets. 
Models listed here are some cases simplified versions of the ones ultimately described in papers, but I chose to focus on getting the core ideas rather than getting every layer configurations right.
