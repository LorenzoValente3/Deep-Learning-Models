# Deep Learning Models

This repository aims to implement different Deep Learning (DL) Models as suggested in research papers, using [Keras](https://keras.io/).
The implemented models are applied to the two different datasets. 
Models listed here are some cases simplified versions of the ones ultimately described in papers.
